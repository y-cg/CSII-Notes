- Operational risks

- Financial risks
- Market risks
- Political risks
- Reputational risks

#q[what is maladaptation in the context of corporate actions.]

Actions increase vulnerability to climate impacts rather than reduce it

#q[Identify two strategic opportunities for companies investing in climate change adaptation.]

- Cost Savings: Reducing operational expenditures through efficiency improvements
- Market Expansion: Tapping into new markets via innovative adaptation solutions.

#q[How does engaging with vulnerable communities relate to corporate reputation?]
- Good Corporate Citizenship: Enhances reputation by solidifying links between business activities and community needs
- Stakeholder Benefits: Increases goodwill among customers and investors

= Waste Management

#q[What is the primary goal of waste management systems?]
- Protect public health, environment
- and ensure sustained economic growth.

#q[Identify two main types of waste generated from industrial processes.]

- Construction and demolition waste
- Hazardous waste (e.g., chemical synthesis, radioactive waste)


#q[How has urbanization impacted waste production?]

Increased population and industrialization lead to higher waste generation

#q[Define common-pool resources and provide two examples.]

Nonexcludable (or non-exclusive) but rival in use.

Examples: 
  - Water in rivers, anyone can use it but it is limited
  - Ocean fisheries, anyone can fish but it is limited


#q[Explain the “tragedy of the commons” concept.]

- Individuals acting in self-interest deplete a shared resource.
- Results in overconsumption and resource depletion

#q[What are the challenges in managing common-pool resources?]
- Overexploitation. (focus on own benefit)
- Lack of cooperation among users

#q[What is negative externality?]

A negative externality is a cost of an action that affects others but not the person doing it.

#q[What is positive externality?]

A positive externality is a benefit of an action that affects others but not the person doing it.

#q[Discuss public policy solutions for addressing negative externalities.]

- Imposing taxes or implementing regulations.
- Aims to align private costs with social costs

= LCA
#q[Define Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in your own words]

- Systematic evaluation of environmental impacts.
- Analyzes inputs/outputs throughout a product's life.
- Includes stages from resource extraction to disposal.

#q[What are the four stages of LCA?]
- Goal & Scope Definition
- Inventory Analysis (LCI)
- Impact Assessment (LCIA)
- Interpretation

#q[List the four general stages of LCI.]

- Raw material acquisition
- Production
- Usage
- End-of-life disposal

#q[What are the four main components of an LCA Scoping]
- Goal and Scope Definition
- Functional Unit
- System Boundaries
- Assumptions and Limitations
- Allocation Methods
- Impact Categories

#q[What is Ecological Footprint?]

An ecological footprint (EF) shows how much land is needed to support a person, city, or country's:

- Resource use (land and water)
- Waste disposal

#q[What is equivalence factor in ecological footprint calculations?]

- measure of productivity of different types of land
- reported as gha (global hectares) per unit of land

#q[Three scope of carbon footprint]

- Scope 1: Direct emissions (from sources owned or controlled by the organization)
- Scope 2: Indirect emissions (from purchased electricity, heat, or steam)
- Scope 3: Indirect emissions (from sources not owned or controlled by the organization)

= Sustainability Entrepreneurship

#q[Describe the characteristics of the first wave in the three-wave typology of business response to sustainability issues.]

- Focuses on risk management.
- Aims to avoid noncompliance consequences.
- Identifies cost-reduction opportunities through process efficiency 

#q[Describe the characteristics of the second wave in the three-wave typology of business response to sustainability issues.]

- Recognizes sustainability as a *strategic necessity*.
- Awareness of *long-term implications* of environmental issues.
- *Opportunities* for market differentiation and innovation.

#q[Explain the ultimate goals of the third wave in the typology.]
- Reinterprets corporations as integral to societal and ecological systems.

#q[A journey of five stages on the path to becoming sustainable]

- Viewing compliance as opportunity
- Making value chains sustainable
- Designing sustainable products and services
- Developing new business models
- Creating next-practice platforms
